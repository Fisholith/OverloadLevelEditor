OPTIMIZATIONS CONTINUED:
* Emit less for explosions/etc
* Create less debris on console (delete more pieces)
* Add support to turn sounds on/off to see how much effect that has on XB1
* Turn AA back on for XB1 (and make it a toggle to make sure it works)
* Increase Bloom to 4 passes (instead of 3) to see if that removes flicker/ghosting
* Add a 2nd page of graphics options
* Make cloaked stuff less weird looking in briefings
* Try SSAO
* Reduce particles (and lights) from Blades charge attack
* Tag all shadow lights that can be unshadowed (all CM/MP/SP levels except cm_backfire)
* Add loading system for faster cloak/trails/robot shaders/etc

OPTIMIZATIONS:
1) Lights fading in at a distance (try a few settings, possibly narrow down a bit)
2) Fewer particles (single setting, affects count, and uses no distortion/simpler versions)
3) Shader complexity (robots, cloak, etc, single setting)
4) Use smaller radius on dynamic lights (based on FX lighting)
5) Add tags for lights to disable shadows (and reduce radius) to be applied to some currently shadow-casting lights
6) Reduce level light radii by default on console (brighter by default) in startup
8) Disable overlay camera drawing when not using, turn off global fog on console?
8a) Reduced natural bloom iterations (3 or 4 instead of 5?)
9) Change all robots (except bosses) to use Animation culling when offscreen.


CUSTOM/LEVEL EDITOR FEATURES
Output CM data file (with music)
Support for skyboxes

GENERAL FEATURES/TWEAKS
Bigger kill message when you die
Message when you get a kill?
Warning when someone is about to win (1 kill away in TA or Anarchy)
Anarchy+Team Anarchy selectable together?
Fix warpers/chunking

7) MAYBE: Re-import all levels with reduced collision on more decals (and more set to none)

CONSOLE TWEAKS
* Reduce lights: Items, lighting/chunking, particles
* Reduce particles: (count, skip some)
* Reduce some default shader settings (not noticeable?)
* Reduce robot shader complexity (safe/easy changes only)

* Use NonAlloc versions of Raycast (and any other physics functions)
* Set sound to use XMA format (instead of OGG) on XB1
Icons for different platforms (check if there's data first)

* Performance: Distortion shader (GrabTexture or "register" command)?

XB1
* Cockpit off by default
* Toggle for VSync
* Output the actual resolution when arriving at Main Menu


CONSOLE
* Enable Graphics Jobs (Experimental) in the Other Settings (of Player Settings)
* Reduced to 60hz physics on console for SP
* Dynamic lighting reduced (OFF effects lighting)
* uConsole disabled
* Reduce hierarchy complexity (unparent stuff as much as possible) 
* Figure out why reflection probe array is empty (and lights are not)
* Disable light probes with OFF effects lighting


* Possible Issue: Loading GI data can take many seconds (final loading phase of a scene)
* Possible Issue: Scene culling can be expensive (particularly reflection probes - possibly try without it?)
* Make sure we're using "UnityEditor.PlayerSettings.PS4.scriptOptimizationLevel = 3;"
* Possible Issue: Should we be using Occlusion Portals to cut off rendering (instead of just occlusion)
* Possible Issue: ALL Audio, especially Mixers might be slow on PS4 (https://ps4.siedev.net/forums/thread/270853/)
-- Possibly fixed by 2017.4?

* XB1 Antialiasing broken? https://forum.unity.com/threads/post-processing-stack-v1-anti-aliasing-not-working-in-builds.535495/



* Use Razor CPU (PS4 installed program) to identify issues?

GSync monitor issues


MAYBE?
Make red buttons more obvious that they're interactive

BIG UPDATE/CONSOLE VERSION











MONSTERBALL
2-3 arenas to start
Everyone has level 2 speed + boost
- Impulse, Driller, and Falcons
5 minute match, highest score wins (time extends until one team wins)
Teleport ball on score, possibly not players

GENERAL
Xbox 360/PS2 buttons

LEVELS (AFTER SP CONVERSION)
(lava fall effects)

UI
Applying changes popup (copy key assignment popup and simplify)

BUG: Should restore energy to min of 100 when starting new level (didn't on 13) - Need repro steps

LEVEL 12
MAYBE: Green debris from power cores by 1st key?


OBJECT EFFECTS
remove mesh effects: warper
matcen fx
warper fx
wind tunnel fx
energy center fx
ec grate fx
robot eye glow fx
item fx (alien orb, cloak, energy, invuln, log, rapid, key, shields, upgrade 1 + 2)
alien pod fx
alien stasis fx

LEVEL EFFECTS
lava fall
lava sparks (need to emit from mesh instead)

OPTIMIZATIONS
SP level textures
Make sure lens flares are totally disabled for robot lights when turned off
Make sure to compile out/optimizing Analytics (taking up time and creating garbage)
- Definitely turn off completely for console


BUGS
Robots drifting

POLISH/ETC
Level 11 sound variety (rifles from Dan)
Better smoothing around lava edges (shouldn't be too hard in theory)
Missile pod sound is weak
Tweak close robot spawning distances

SOMEONE ELSE
Set CM level selection to correct level/screen when you return to the CM Menu


UPDATES
* Daily CM - play once, or any number of times?
-- Once, and tell player some details (level + weapons)?
-- Or once, with no details, so player communication is encouraged?


MAYBE
Lightning arcs on clawbot
"Level Life" items - Pipes spewing smoke, rotating/flashing lights, simple animated pumps
Create fewer particles when already many alive
Better explosion sound on Powercores?
Creeper mines jitter, why???
Differentiate CM robot surge more
Show boss name and play taunt animation/effects for a brief moment
- Try to tie taunt into what boss does effectively
Make damage appear to be more in-front and behind based on direction (angle the forward vec down by 30-45 degrees?)
Reset damage points on respawn
Aim assist too weak (may have to make it better too)
Simple (non-interactive) light shafts on narrow spotlights
Flashing/rotating lights (with appropriate texture pulse)


EVERSPACE IDEAS/ETC
* Mouse:
-- Mouse stays in position on screen (circular limit), ship turns to look in that direction
-- Leaving mouse alone keeps moving ship in that direction
-- Aiming of guns goes towards cursor, not front of ship (could maybe turn ship/cockpit as mouse moves?)

MUSIC INSPIRATION (aside from the soundtrack direction doc)
* PrototypeRaptor - Golden Idols (intro)
See email to Allister about track 4
